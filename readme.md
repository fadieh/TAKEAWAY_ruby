# Takeaway - Week 2 Challenge

This is the weekend challenge from Week 2 during the Makers Academy Sept '14 curriculum.

The aim was to create a takeaway system that contains a menu of various items, which a person can order from. Once the order is complete, the system should send a text using the Twilio API to confirm the order and give an ETA for the food.

##### Technologies used
- Ruby 2.1.2
- Rspec 3.1.7
- Twilio API

### How to use

##### Clone the repository

    $ git clone https://github.com/fadieh/TAKEAWAY_ruby.git
    
##### Change into the directory

    $ cd TAKEAWAY_ruby
    
##### Run the tests

    $ rspec
    
### What I learned

This is the task where I really got to grips with doubles in testing. Also I learned that writing the inject method many times taught me about yielding to blocks within a method and really helped with the logic behind the process.
